## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Responsible Usage
- Only test on networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- Ensure testing is conducted in isolated environments when possible
- Be aware of local laws and regulations regarding wireless security testing
- Use strong passwords for the device's access point

### Detection Avoidance
- Randomize MAC addresses when possible
- Vary attack timing and patterns
- Use appropriate power levels to limit range
- Monitor for intrusion detection systems

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device not creating access point**:
- Check power supply (ensure adequate current)
- Verify board selection in Arduino IDE
- Reset the device and wait for initialization

**Web interface not loading**:
- Ensure you're connected to the device's WiFi network
- Try accessing `192.168.4.1` directly
- Clear browser cache and try again

**Attacks not working**:
- Verify target information (SSID, MAC, channel)
- Check if target is within range
- Ensure legal authorization for testing

**ESP32 BLE features not available**:
- Verify ESP32 board is selected (not ESP8266)
- Check that BLE is not disabled in code
- Restart device if BLE initialization fails
